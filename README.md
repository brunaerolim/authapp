# 🔐 Authentication App (Work in Progress)

This is a mobile authentication project built using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM**, and *
*Hilt** for dependency injection. The goal is to create a modern and robust authentication flow
using **email/password** and **Google Sign-In**, following Google’s recommended best practices and
clean architecture principles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose** – for declarative UI development
- **MVVM Architecture** – clean separation of concerns
- **Hilt** – for dependency injection
- **Firebase Authentication** (coming soon)
- **Google Sign-In** (in progress)

## 🚧 Project Status

This is an **ongoing implementation**. Core features are being developed and tested. Below are
